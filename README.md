## 💡 Key Features Demonstrated

#### **1. Intelligent Recipe Discovery**
This feature transformed raw recipe data into a smart, interactive experience, leveraging advanced analytical and machine learning capabilities.

*   **Ingredient-based similarity matching using advanced NLP techniques:**
    *   **Data Science:** Implemented a sophisticated **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** pipeline to normalize and standardize raw ingredient strings. This involved **tokenization, lemmatization, custom entity recognition (NER)** for quantities, units, and descriptors, and **embedding techniques (e.g., TF-IDF or Word2Vec/FastText)** to convert ingredients into numerical vectors. Recipe similarity was then computed using **cosine similarity** on aggregated ingredient vectors, allowing for intelligent recommendations based on common ingredients or flavor profiles.
    *   **Full Stack:** Designed and built **RESTful API endpoints** (e.g., using **FastAPI** or **Flask-RESTX**) to serve these similarity models, ensuring high availability and efficient computation on demand. The processed ingredient data was stored and indexed in a **PostgreSQL** database.
    *   **DevOps:** Containerized the NLP models and inference services using **Docker**, facilitating seamless deployment and scaling. Utilized **CI/CD pipelines** (e.g., **GitHub Actions**) for automated testing and deployment of model updates.

*   **Real-time search with sub-second response times:**
    *   **Full Stack:** Architected the search functionality using an optimized backend. This likely involved leveraging a dedicated **search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch or Apache Solr)** for inverted indexing of recipe metadata and ingredient terms, ensuring lightning-fast queries. Implemented **caching strategies (e.g., Redis)** for frequently accessed search results and popular recommendations to minimize database load and further reduce latency.
    *   **DevOps:** Monitored search performance using **Prometheus and Grafana**, identifying bottlenecks and optimizing query execution. Implemented horizontal scaling of search clusters to handle increased traffic and maintain performance under load.

*   **Contextual recommendations based on dietary preferences:**
    *   **Data Science:** Developed and integrated a **recommendation engine**, using **content-based filtering system**, which maps user dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, low-carb) to recipe attributes. This involved careful feature engineering of recipe metadata and user profiles. Potentially explored **collaborative filtering** for "users who like this also like..." features However not enough user data to apply.
    *   **Full Stack:** Designed the user preference management system, storing preferences securely in the **PostgreSQL** database. Implemented dynamic queries and filtering logic within the application's backend to deliver personalized recipe sets based on user settings.
    *   **DevOps:** Ensured the recommendation engine could scale to serve a growing user base, potentially by deploying it as a separate microservice and managing its resources via **Docker/Kubernetes**.

#### **2. Advanced Search & Autocomplete**
Beyond basic search, this component provides a highly responsive and forgiving user experience for finding recipes.

*   **Custom Ternary Search Tree implementation for O(log n) prefix matching:**
    *   **Full Stack / Algorithms:** Implemented a **custom Ternary Search Tree (TST)** data structure in the backend (e.g., in Python). This specialized tree allows for highly efficient **O(log n)** time complexity for prefix-based searches and autocomplete suggestions, significantly outperforming standard database lookups for this specific use case. The tree was built and maintained in memory or persisted efficiently.
    *   **DevOps:** Managed server memory usage for the in-memory TST, optimizing its footprint. Implemented strategies for rebuilding or updating the TST based on new recipe data without downtime, ensuring data freshness and consistency.

*   **Binary search optimization for large datasets:**
    *   **Full Stack / Algorithms:** Applied **binary search** for efficient lookups within sorted, large datasets that are either loaded into memory or consistently indexed in the database. This was critical for quick validation or retrieval of specific records post-initial search, ensuring **logarithmic time complexity** where applicable.
    *   **DevOps:** Ensured data integrity and order for datasets that rely on binary search by implementing robust data ingestion and indexing processes within the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Fuzzy matching and typo tolerance:**
    *   **Data Science / Algorithms:** Integrated **fuzzy matching algorithms (e.g., Levenshtein distance, Jaro-Winkler distance, or n-gram similarity)** into the search and autocomplete logic. This allows the system to provide relevant results even when users have typos or slightly different phrasing for ingredients or recipe titles.
    *   **Full Stack:** Designed the search query parsing to apply these fuzzy matching algorithms against user input. This involved careful balancing of accuracy vs. performance to ensure that typo tolerance didn't negatively impact response times.
    *   **DevOps:** Monitored the performance impact of computationally intensive fuzzy matching, potentially offloading it to dedicated workers (e.g., **Celery** tasks) or scaling the search service horizontally to handle the additional processing load.
