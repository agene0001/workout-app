# Workout App
## Overview
This is a workout app I've built with the goal of helping users achieve their dietary needs and better achieve an active lifestyle as well as show off a bit of my full stack and data science Skills.
My initial goal was for this to be an archive of Jiu-Jitsu/Judo moves I learned from my gym but I quickly switched to providing nutritional support.
My idea was to create a work-around to hellofresh and give users the ability to see a recipe and export the ingredients to a delivery provider like Amazon Fresh or Instacart.
This application is nowhere near finished as I wasn't able to get a workable solution to with amazon or instacart but I wish to display the progress I've made thus far, 
encourage contributions and display the other features I've implemented including a recipe recommender, recipe autocomplete and a help chatbot.
